Vertebrate spermatogonial stem cells maintain sperm production over the lifetime of an animal but fertility declines with age. While morphological studies have greatly informed our understanding of typical spermatogenesis in zebrafish, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis, and in particular the onset of infertility, are not yet understood. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a developmental atlas of the zebrafish testis. Using 5 time points across the adult life of a zebrafish, we described cellular profiles in the testis during and after fertility. While all germ cell stages of spermatogenesis are detected in testes from fertile adult zebrafish, testes from older infertile males only contained spermatogonia and a reduced population of spermatocytes. These remaining germ cells are transcriptionally distinct from fertile spermatogonia. Immune cells including macrophages and leukocytes drastically increase in abundance in infertile testes. Molecular imaging confirmed an increase in macrophages in the testes of infertile animals. Our developmental atlas reveals the cellular changes as the testis ages and defines a molecular roadmap for the regulation of male fertility.
